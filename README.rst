which sends mails to an arbitrary list of recipients of all types (To,CC and
BCC). Attachements are supported.


TODO
====

* Documentation

* Add support for Velocity files as Message bodies

  * Check whether body is a string or vm

  * Get MavenProject initialized in unittests 

* (Optional) Recurse subdirectories in case an attachement tag points to a directory
